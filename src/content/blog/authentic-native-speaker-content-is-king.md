Way too many people get stuck translating phrases like "the big red dog sat on top of the car" and then retranslating back to English in the process of learning a language. This kind of thing is only useful in the very beginning stages; it should be stopped relatively quickly.

The best content to consume is true, authentic native-speaker audio with a transcript. This makes up the bulk of my learning time. It is simply the richest, most information-packed, most exciting way to engage with the language. It also allows you to connect sounds with written words and look up unfamiliar vocabulary, something essential that you miss with ***just*** audio.

Not only do you start improving your listening comprehension from day 1 rather than putting it off until you are "ready", you also get content that is more likely to be interesting and fun.

The audio that you select doesn't have to be something difficult. There are plenty of native speaker podcasts that specifically target people who are learning, so they speak slower. Think of it as a sort of middle ground. It isn't the banal "red dog" sentences of some apps which I won't name, and it isn't a complicated news broadcast. It is just a native speaker speaking authentically, with all the correct intonation and pronunciation, just a bit slower for your improved comprehension. These materials build a bridge between beginner and advanced content, and they end up making up the bulk of the content that I consume over the entire learning process from upper beginner to lower advanced.
